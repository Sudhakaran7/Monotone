Subi is fond of string and numbers, so she decided to play with by string as "Monotone Increasing" string
a string of 0's and 1's, if it consists of some number of '0's (possibly 0), followed by some number of '1's (also possibly 0.)
we may flip any '0' to a '1' or a '1' to a '0'.
Return the minimum number of flips to make S monotone increasing.

Input Description:
A string containing 0's and 1's

Output Description:
the minimum number of flips to make S monotone increasing

Sample Input:
00101

Sample Output:
1

Explanation:
the digit 0 at place 4 can be changed so that 00111 can be attained so the output is 1 (00111, two 0's and three 1's, that is monotone increasing string)

Sample Input:
0100110

Sample Output:
